		<h1>Hello, I'm Julie !</h1>
		<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Julie Motrot">
		<p>
			I am a motivated and versatile 18-year-old student in my first year of the Parcours Grandes Ã‰coles at the IESEG School of Management. My interest in many different sectors has always led me to stay active. Among these sectors, artistic creation is a particular passion, including photography, music, especially the guitar, as well as drawing. Self-development is also an exciting area from my perspective. More than anything I love discovering and learning new skills, such as coding which I am currently exploring.

		<h2>Business</h2>
		<p>
			I have various experiences in Business, including 3 internships in a bookstore and a real estate agency, but also a one-and-a-half-month temporary contract with Burger King in 2023. I decided to continue my career path in commerce, in the IESEG prestigious school, in order to later direct myself towards marketing. I love to work with colleagues and lead operations thanks to my ability to understand others and stay organised.

		<h2>Artistic Creation</h2>
		<p>
			You can often see me doing activities needing creativity, or walking in the streets, my camera by hand. 
			I have practised drawing for 7 years now, using diverse tools such as paper but also design tablets. 
			I have been passionate about music since I was 10 years old; it allows me to relax, gain motivation or even work more efficiently. I began to learn guitar 3 years ago. 
			Concerning photography, I learned how to use a camera 2 years ago and don't often go out without it.

		<h2>Self-development</h2>
		<p>
			I stay motivated by always improving my competencies and skills. I discovered self-development books when I was 12 and I became really interested, especially in those concerning the ability to communicate with others and understand how they function so it is easier to move in the social world. One book I particularly recommend is "The Four Agreements" written by Don Miguel Ruiz, It can change your vision of yourself and the world in a great interesting way.
